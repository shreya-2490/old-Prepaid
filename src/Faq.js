                Our prepaid card allows you to purchase it using
                cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and then load it with
                your desired amount. You can then spend the loaded value in
                dollars, just like any regular prepaid card.

                Currently, we accept Bitcoin (BTC) as the primary cryptocurrency
                for purchasing our prepaid cards. However, we are actively
                exploring the integration of additional cryptocurrencies in the
                near future.

                fees.
